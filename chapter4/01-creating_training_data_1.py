# spaCyâ€™s rule-based Matcher is a great way to quickly create training data for
# named entity models. A list of sentences is available as the variable TEXTS.
# You can print it the IPython shell to inspect it. We want to find all
# mentions of different iPhone models, so we can create training data to teach
# a model to recognize them as 'GADGET'.

# Write a pattern for two tokens whose lowercase forms match 'iphone' and 'x'.
# Write a pattern for two tokens: one token whose lowercase form matches
# 'iphone' and an optional digit using the '?' operator.
